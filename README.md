# inline_web

This repository hosts the code for the client side of project *inline*. This was part of my final project while studying software engineering at the University of Iceland. An in depth thesis was written for the project and can be found here: http://hdl.handle.net/1946/35691. <br/> <br/>
At the moment, the SMS feature of *inline* is not available for everyone, so if you are interested in using *inline* feel free to contact me. A running instance of the website (note that it is not perfect but works ðŸ¤ ): https://web-inline.herokuapp.com/.
